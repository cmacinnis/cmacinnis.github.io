						<p>I think that my leadership skills have fallen short to some degree during the first few rounds of the Capsim competition. I have asserted myself as the leader of the group using my in-depth knowledge of how to play the game, and while our team has been successful I am unhappy with our decision making process.</p>

<p>After our result in round one played out almost exactly as I had predicted my team basically indicated that they had faith in me to generally dictate overall strategy. All of the decisions that I have suggested have been based on logic, calculations, and my notes from playing the tutorial repeatedly. While I appreciate the trust my teammates have in me to make decisions about what to do each year, I am also perturbed by the lack of questioning I sometimes receive about my decisions. </p>

<p>Our group would be healthier if my teammates challenged me more about my decisions. While my decisions seem have been as close to optimal as possible thus far, it is possible that I have made mistakes at some point, or that there is some factor that I have not considered. Having others critique ones work can sometimes bring to light deficiencies or flaws that would not have been apparent otherwise. I believe that my teammates are somewhat intimidated by the extensive notes I have compiled, as well as the numerous formulae that I have developed in order to inform our decisions. I assume that they are worried about coming off as uninformed if they ask me a question, or dispute an idea I have put forth. </p>

</br>

<p>Moving forward I intend to make my decision making process even more transparent in an attempt to better inform my group members about why I suggest the things I do, and to give them a better basis in challenging my ideas. I will also be more assertive in asking people for their opinions, and will actively invite criticism of my strategies.</p>

<p>Capsim is a relatively simple game, and I am fairly confident that the general strategy I have come up with is sound, and will lead us to victory. Even if I am correct in my assumption, this will not be true for projects in the future. It is absolutely essential for me to balance my own style of thinking and decision making with making sure other can vet my ideas. In a professional environment it will likely be impossible for me to be an expert in every area, so I will need teammates who aggressively challenge my ideas and assumptions to ensure that my work, or my team’s collaborative work is as high quality as it should be.</p>
