					<h2 id="ref-title">Reflection 1A</h2>
					<p>Throughout the early stages of the ARBUS 400 Capsim competition I have shown an extremely high level of <b><i>initiative</i></b>. I dedicated multiple hours almost every day before the practice rounds to playing through the tutorial numerous times to learn more about the intricacies of the game. After I got a good feel for how Capsim worked, I continued using the tutorial for testing purposes. My group started to formulate a strategy during the practice rounds so I used the tutorial to test different potential tactics and to better judge the impact of each unique variable in the simulation. This due diligence allowed me to prescribe what I determined to be the correct course of action with a high degree of confidence.</p>
					<p>For each input our group had to make <b><i>I was able to critically analyze the situation and contribute to an informed decision</i></b> based on the extensive amount of work I had put into this project. At this point in the simulation it is impossible to draw definite conclusions about the effectiveness of our decisions, it is however worth noting that we have not needed the emergency loan, and there have been no surprises thus far. In the first year we expected that we would lose money so I insisted that we borrow the maximum amount allowed in long term debt, as well as issuing the maximum amount of shares. These decisions prevented us from needing the emergency loan after the first year of the simulation.</p>
					<p>I knew from the beginning of ARBUS 400 that I would be putting significant time into learning the game and perfecting our strategy, just as I had done in my first year of university wherein my Mike’s Bikes team placed first in our industry and had the highest share price in our class. <b><i>I am a naturally competitive person who hates losing with a passion. This can be a positive in some situations</i></b>, such as simulations like this one. However it can also be a negative when I am involved in competitions that are supposed to be about having fun instead of focusing only on winning. I have learned throughout my life that one of the keys to winning a competition is to simply out-work all of the competition. I prepared so much that we decided as a group that the practice rounds were unnecessary, because we did not want to reveal our strategy to our opponents. I suggested that we deliberately choose the most erratic inputs possible in order to make the information from the practice round useless to our opponents. I would be curious to know if our feigned incompetence instilled a greater degree of confidence in them going into the first year.</p>

					<p>Before starting this competition I pledged to my teammates that I would outwork everyone else in the class when it came to learning how to play the game, and attempting to create the optimal strategy. I fully intend to keep this promise.</p>
