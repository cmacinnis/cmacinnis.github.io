					<h2 id="ref-title">WatCV 2</h2>
					<p>During
my time at the University of Waterloo studying Arts and Business, I
participated in a business simulation that allowed me to enrich my
critical thinking skills. The simulation required students to work in
groups to manage a firm that produces and sells sensors. We were
tasked with managing a wide variety of business functions including
marketing, production, R&amp;D, and finance.</p>

<p>In
the third year of the simulation, my group encountered some
difficulties as we fell short of our sales projections and ended up
requiring a 13 million dollar emergency bailout. This shortfall
happened because two of the competing firms released new products in
our strongest market segment. These new products effectively cut our
demand in half. We had produced approximately 4000 units of our
product which we expected to sell, but at the end of the year we
still had about 2000 units left. The excess units caused us to incur
significant warehousing costs which in turn caused our company to
lose money. </p>

<p>I
was asked by my group members to develop a strategy to respond to our
poor performance in the previous in-game year.  I needed to find a
way to return to prosperity so that we could continue investing
resources in efficiency measures to make our firm more profitable in
the long term. </p>

<p>I
thought deeply about the challenge of adjusting our strategy, and
developed several tools for helping to create a new strategy.  One
approach that I developed was to analyze the actions of the other
teams, especially the ones that had taken our market share for the
first three years of the simulation. By looking at the other teams’
decisions I was able to gain a better understanding of the strategies
they were pursuing which allowed me to better plan our strategy.
Another consideration that I included in my strategic planning was
the fact that one of the other teams had introduced two of their
allotted three new products into the segment where we lost our market
share. I realized that this meant they would be vulnerable in other
market segments where we would be able to introduce new products and
they would not. Another realization that I made was that we had
almost enough of our excess product to produce nothing in that market
segment for the next year. The vastly reduced production costs for
that product allowed me to allocate significant sums of money into
the marketing and production optimization of other products which
would allow us to make more money into the future.</p>

<p>Ultimately my decision paid off as our team ended up placing first
amongst our competition. By realizing that we could not directly
compete in the segment where we had lost a significant amount of
market share, and allocating resources elsewhere, we were able to
gain an edge over our competition that would ultimately lead to our
victory. Our company ended up making 144 million dollars in
cumulative profit, greater than 50 million dollars more than the
second place team.</p>
